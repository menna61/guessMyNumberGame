# how it works
1- Start: When you first access the game, you will see the message "Guess My Number!" along with the range of numbers displayed as "(Between 1 and 20)".

2- Guessing: You can start guessing the number by entering your guess in the input field provided. Once you've entered your guess, click on the "Check!" button to check if your guess is correct.

3- Feedback: After clicking the "Check!" button, the game will provide feedback to let you know if your guess was too high or too low. 
If your guess is correct, you will see a message indicating that you have guessed the number correctly.

4- Scoring: The game keeps track of your score, which is initially set to 20. Each time you make a guess, regardless of whether it is correct or not, 
your score decreases by one. The goal is to guess the number correctly with the fewest number of attempts possible to achieve a higher score.

5- Highscore: The game also displays a highscore, which is initially set to 0. This represents the highest score achieved by any player. 
If you manage to beat the current highscore during your gameplay, it will be updated accordingly.

6- Play Again: After guessing the correct number or if you simply want to start a new game, you can click on the "Again!" button. This will reset the game and allow you to start guessing a new number.
